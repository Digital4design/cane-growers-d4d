                    <p class="mb-8">Recommendations for optimal nitrogen rates have become more accurate and specific; there is greater attention to ensuring all plant nutrients are in adequate supply; trash retention has reduced erosion; controlled traffic farming and reduced tillage have improved soil structure and reduced costs. While well-managed legume fallows help break pest and disease cycles while reducing fertiliser costs and improving soil health.</p>
                    <p>The need to focus on soil health, not just nitrogen, and the importance of good agronomic practices is clear. Its evident that improved soil biology achieves healthier soils resulting in better yields, benefiting both the farm business and the environment.</p>
